             BCC 2023 was my first, and since that meeting, I have experienced a tangible expression and flow of the supernatural. After BCC 2023, I got about 3 job offers that I had to pick from. Also, my faith walk was stirred up in that meeting.

            <p class="testimony-card-text">
             Believers Cave Conference has really impacted my life in great measures.

The first time I attended was in 2020, and it was awesomely amazing. After that encounter, I have never missed the camp meeting since then.

            </p>

             <p class="testimony-card-text">
              It was in BCC that I learned how to study God's word and interpret the scriptures. It was in Believers Cave Conference that I began to experience the supernatural and the miraculous, and since then, I began to have a consistent prayer life.
My expectations are high already, I can't wait to be in BCC'25

            <h3 class="testimony-card-title">I GOT THE JOB!</h3>
            <p class="testimony-card-text">
             During BCC'24, Pastor Ibukun Ali gave words in a particular session that people will receive jobs and there was an application I already applied for before camp meeting, I even sent a follow up mail but there I didn't receive a response. After BCC, I got an acceptance mail, and  I was surprised because that was the least place I expected to be called back for a job.

            <p class="testimony-card-text">
              The first thing I will say is that every BCC is like a new year for me. I attend each BCC expecting directions from God. During the camp meeting in 2024, Pastor Ibukun Ali gave me words I am still running with. 
            </p>
            <p class="testimony-card-text">
             I also have testimonies of healings. There was a time (BCC 23)  when Pastor prayed for my mum who was sick via a phone call, and she got healed. That same year, I also had pains on my knees, and Pastor asked us to lay hands on it, I did, and I was healed.

            <p class="testimony-card-text">
              In 2022, during my compulsory service year, I had the privilege of attending BCC.
At the time, I was awaiting admission and resumption into the Nigerian Law School. During one of the sessions, I received prophetic words concerning my law school journey; about the kind of people I would encounter and how the entire process would unfold. I wrote those words down and held on to them. Now, three years later, I’m a lawyer, and every single word has come to pass!
            </p>
            <p class="testimony-card-text">
             As I step into this year’s meeting, my heart is full of expectation. I’m ready to receive everything God has in store for me.
