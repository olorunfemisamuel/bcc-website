              For many I will say is that every BCC is like a new year for me. I started from BCC becoming a new person from there. I have been going to BCC for the past 4 years and every year I come back with a new perspective about life and ministry.

              I can't even comprehend of happenings. There was a time I BCC 21 when Pastor prayed for me there was an oil that came out from my head. I have never experienced such before. I can't even explain or they talked BCC, I felt alive and healed.

              At that year's BCC Pastor Bukun hit some words that people will answer yes and there was an expectant capacity. When he said those that have been struggling with something and I was struggling with something and I was meeting and I was confident because that was the exact thing I was struggling back for 5 yrs.

              Believers Cave Conference has really impacted my life. The first time I went to BCC 2019 it was amazing and I learnt a lot.

            <p class="testimony-card-text">
              I learnt how to study the word of God through the different expositions. It was in Believers Cave Conference that I began to understand the supernatural and the natural. I learnt how to study God's word and how to apply it to my life.

              BCC 2019 was my first and since that meeting I've experienced a different dimension and there's this fire that I carry. I remember there was a particular message Pastor Bukun preached and it was like he was talking to me.
